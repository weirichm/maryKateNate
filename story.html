                        Nathan had been working there for about a year already, and one of my friends told me that it was a great place to work 
                        so I applied! I thought that we had never met before, but little by little I learned that Nathan and I both 
                        went to NC State and were in at least two classes together. He recognized me immediately as his former classmate and girl 
                        he'd see around campus during the past four years, but I never remembered seeing him! 
                        He even (as I later found out) had a crush on me in our class, freshman year! Though we worked in different departments, 
                        we got to know each other at Videri (thanks to a lot of crossword puzzles) and started spending 
                        more time together outside of work. The more I saw Nathan around his friends and doing the things he 
                        loves (i.e. music! "Nathan Kornegay" on Spotify, anyone?), he became someone that I knew I wanted to 
                        hang out with, talk to, laugh with, joke with, and love for the rest of my life. Which brings me to... 
                        the engagement!</p>
                    <br>   
                    <p style= "padding-left: 20px"> We got engaged right after Thanksgiving last year, at Videri. It was so sweet, and totally a surprise! 
                        I knew that we would be getting engaged soon, but I had NO idea what Nathan had planned! 
                        It was a Sunday, so Nathan had to work, and I was busy during the day visiting my nieces and getting 
                        coffee with a friend in the afternoon (who was totally in on all of the engagement planning, by the way!). 
                        Nathan came to pick me up to go to church in the evening, and I was distracted with online Christmas shopping 
                        and didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. He even had the ring in his pocket while we were at church! 
                        We had already planned to go to Crank Arm after, for drinks, but he said that we needed to go to Videri first 
                        because of some inventory numbers that he had forgotten to log. (This should have sounded weird to me on a 
                        Sunday evening, but I totally believed him in the moment!) When we got inside, candles were lining the entryway, 
                        music was playing, and one of our friends was there with a camera. Nathan immediately got down on one knee and 
                        asked me to marry him-- it was so much more beautiful and perfect than I could have ever imagined for myself! 
                        And just when I thought it couldn't get any better, we walked next door to Crank Arm, and a huge group of our 
                        friends were waiting to greet us and celebrate!! It was the most perfect night!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p style= "padding-left: 20px">We are so excited to share in our joy and excitement with all of you now! 
                        Every one of you plays an important part in our stories individually, and now as we join our 
                        lives together. We cannot wait to celebrate with you on June 23rd! </p>
